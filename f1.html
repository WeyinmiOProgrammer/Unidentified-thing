  <p id = no>A great famine has fallen upon your village, a clear result of the corruption of the wasp mafia and the constant threat of 8 legged assassins killing your suppliers before they can reach home. You have been tasked with supplying your village with food. A daunting task for many of your kind. But, you know that many wingbuzzes from your current location is a giant vault full of food. You have to get there quickly, as it becomes heavily fortitfied at night. You're going to need to cover a lot of distance. You are also armed with 1 grenade, which you should use wisely.</p>
